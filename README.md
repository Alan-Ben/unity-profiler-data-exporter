# Unity Profiler Data Exporter
Utility to export data from the unity profiler.

This is a first working version but I plan to add other features shortly.
Anyone who wants to contribute is very welcome, just make a pull request.

# Installation
Just copy the script in an Editor directory within your unity Assets folder.

# Usage
Open the unity profiler and when you want to export the profiler data for further analysis just click on one of the options under the `Profiler Data Exporter` menu.
A `profiler_data.json` file will be generated in your project directory.
